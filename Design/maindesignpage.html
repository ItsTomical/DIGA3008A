        <p>
          My goal for this website is to create a platform that showcases my
          portfolio in a simple, engaging, and accessible way. I want to attract
          a diverse audience, including potential employers, collaborators,
          peers, and casual visitors like friends and family by presenting my
          work through a clean, modern, and minimalistic design that prioritizes
          ease of navigation and visual clarity.

          <h3>Interface Elements</h3>
          <p>
            My portfolio website includes a range of interactive elements that
            improve usability and align with my UI/UX goals. These features help
            users navigate smoothly, engage with content, and understand the
            structure of the site. Below is a summary of the key interface
            elements I implemented:
          </p>

          <h4>1. Buttons</h4>
          <p>
            Buttons are used throughout the site to support intuitive navigation
            and content exploration:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              “Read More” / “View”: Found under blog entries, essays, and
              project previews to reveal full content.
            </li>
            <li>
              “Back to Top”: Present at the bottom of longer pages, making it
              easier for users to return to the top.
            </li>
            <li>
              “Back to Blog Page” / “Back to Essay Page”: Clearly directs users
              back to the overview page after viewing a specific post, replacing
              the need for breadcrumbs.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>2. Sticky Navigation Bar</h4>
          <p>
            The navigation bar stays fixed at the top of the screen. On the
            homepage, it enables smooth scrolling to each section (e.g.,
            Portfolio, Design Process). On other pages, it provides direct links
            to each main section of the site, ensuring easy access no matter
            where the user is.
          </p>

          <h4>3. Icons</h4>
          <p>I use icons as quick visual links to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>My GitHub profile</li>
            <li>Contact options (e.g., email, Instagram)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These provide an efficient, minimal way for users to connect with me
            and explore more of my work.
          </p>

          <h4>4. Hover Effects</h4>
          <p>
            Buttons, links, and profile elements feature hover effects — such as
            color changes, movement, or animations — to signal interactivity.
            These small details enhance feedback and make the site feel more
            dynamic and polished.
          </p>

          <h4>5. Lightbox for Images and Animations</h4>
          <p>
            Portfolio items and animations use a lightbox feature that displays
            media in a fullscreen modal. This allows users to view images and
            videos without navigating away from the current page. Lightboxes
            also support keyboard navigation (arrows and ESC), improving both
            accessibility and user experience.
          </p>

          <h2>Style Process Documentation</h2>
          <p>
            My style process began with a clear intention: to design a website
            that feels clean, modern, and easy to navigate. From the start, I
            aimed for a minimalist visual aesthetic that focused on readability,
            a balance of text and imagery, and smooth user interaction. As the
            project developed, I refined and updated several elements—including
            colour palette, typography, and layout—to strengthen the overall
            design and improve user experience.
          </p>

          <h3>Visual Aesthetic and Layout</h3>
          <p>
            The overall aesthetic of the site is simple and uncluttered,
            supporting a smooth and focused browsing experience. I wanted the
            interface to feel modern and professional, with enough breathing
            space between elements to reduce cognitive load. A grid-based layout
            structure keeps everything aligned and consistent, while intentional
            spacing improves readability and guides the user’s attention to key
            content and navigation elements.
          </p>

          <h3>Colour Palette: Evolution and Refinement</h3>
          <p>
            Initially, I planned to use a neutral background (white or light
            beige) with accent colours like blue or green to highlight buttons
            and links. The idea was to keep the interface calm and organised,
            with subtle colour cues to help guide navigation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Later, I refined the palette to make it more cohesive, accessible,
            and visually distinctive. I defined a system of primary, neutral,
            and secondary colours that provide stronger contrast, support
            content hierarchy, and add personality without overwhelming the
            design:
          </p>

          <h4>Primary Colours:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Black #000000 – For text, icons, and high-contrast UI elements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Delft Blue #3C415B – A deep, refined tone used in headings,
              backgrounds, and core interface components.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Neutral Colours:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              White #FFFFFF – Used to create clean visual contrast in large
              headers or page backgrounds.
            </li>
            <li>
              Almond #E6DACE – A soft, warm neutral applied to cards and section
              dividers to visually group content.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Secondary Colours (Accents):</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ash Grey #B2C7B6 – A muted green used subtly for highlights,
              icons, and hover states.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cambridge Blue #8DA69B – A soft accent used in borders or
              background details.
            </li>
            <li>
              Jasper #B75B47 – A bold, warm tone used to draw attention to CTAs,
              numbers, or important text elements.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This refined system offers better balance, visual interest, and
            consistency across the site.
          </p>

          <h3>Typography: Initial Plan and Adjustments</h3>
          <p>
            Originally, I selected Poppins for headings and Georgia for body
            text. Poppins offered a modern, clean look that fit well with the
            design, while Georgia brought a classic, readable tone to longer
            paragraphs.
          </p>
          <p>
            After further testing, I updated the body font to Tinos—a serif font
            like Georgia, but with better on-screen readability and a more
            modern feel. This combination of Poppins for headings and Tinos for
            body text now forms a strong typographic pairing that balances
            clarity, structure, and personality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Font sizes follow a clear visual hierarchy to guide users through
            the page, distinguishing headings, subheadings, and paragraphs with
            consistent scaling and spacing.

              The Seth Hampton portfolio website is my main inspiration. It can
              be found
              <a href="https://sethhamptonportfolio.webflow.io/" target="_blank"
                >here</a
              >. I like the layout of the site. Initially, I wanted my website
              to look like this, all on one page. However, in the end I found it
              to be a little much. What I don’t like about it is when you’re on
              a section such as “about” or “resume”, you have to scroll through
              the entire section to be able to proceed to the next section of
              the webpage.

              I was also inspired by the Maya Nelson layout on Wix, which can be
              found
              <a
                href="https://www.wix.com/demone2/personal-resume/resume"
                target="_blank"
                >here</a
              >. I like the layout and design of the information in this
              example. It almost appears to be in the form of postcards that
              align in the centre of the page. What I don’t like, however, is
              the colour scheme. It’s a bit too bland. Initially, I thought it
              might be a somewhat soothing colour, but I want viewers to be
              energised and excited by my work, so I needed some colour that
              would be more active.

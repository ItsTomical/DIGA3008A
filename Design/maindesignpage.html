        <h3>Week 5 - Design Section</h3>
        <p>
          This week, I am further defining and justifying my design decisions
          based on Blog 4. Since my wireframes and user flow are already
          structured, I am focusing on refining my fonts, colour choices, and
          layout to improve both usability and visual appeal.
        </p>

        <h4>Refining my Design Choices</h4>

        <h5>Navigation and User Flow</h5>
        <p>
          My website’s navigation remains structured around a sticky navigation
          bar. This will ensure that employers and collaborators can quickly
          access my portfolio; peers and lecturers can easily find my blog posts
          and essays; and casual viewers can explore my portfolio highlights and
          general updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Blog 4, my user flow diagram defined key interactions. I am keeping
          this structure but will consider fine-tuning button placements, menu
          behaviour, and scroll interactions – like when you are on the home
          page and click on the sticky navigation bar to go to the blogs, it
          scrolls down the home page to that section.
        </p>

        <h5>Font Update: Georgia vs Tinos</h5>
        <p>
          While refining my font choices, I discovered that Georgia isn’t a free
          font, which could cause accessibility issues. To keep the same classic
          and professional look, I chose Tinos, a similar open-source font.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s an image comparison of Georgia vs Tinos to show how this change
          affects the visual hierarchy and readability of my site.
        </p>

        <h5>Colour Palette Refinement</h5>
        <p>My new palette comprises the following colours:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>White (background)</li>
          <li>Almond (soft neutral for warmth)</li>
          <li>Ash Gray (subtle grey for contrast)</li>
          <li>Cambridge Blue (muted blue-green for accents)</li>
          <li>Jasper (rich red for highlights)</li>
          <li>Delft Blue (deep blue for emphasis)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>My original palette idea included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>White</li>
          <li>Almond</li>
          <li>Timberwolf</li>
          <li>Cadet Gray</li>
          <li>Cambridge Blue</li>
          <li>RISD Blue</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Why the change?</strong> My original palette had softer,
          low-contrast colours, making it harder to highlight key elements.
          Replacing Timberwolf and Cadet Grey with Jasper (a richer red) and
          Delft Blue (a deeper blue) improved contrast and readability, making
          headings, buttons, hyperlinks and interactive elements stand out more
          clearly.
        </p>

        <h5>Layout and Composition</h5>
        <p>
          Building on Blog 4’s wireframes, and taking inspiration from some of
          my reference websites, I am continuing to refine the grid system to
          create a clean, balanced, and visually appealing layout. Focus will be
          on using white space for improved readability; ensuring that buttons
          and interactive elements are prominent; and aligning sections for a
          strong visual flow.
        </p>

              >Maya Nelson Layout</a
            >
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong>Conclusion:</strong> This week, I focused on refining my
          colour choices, fonts, and layout to improve contrast, readability,
          and usability. My updated colour palette and font I think keeps my
          website visually cohesive and easy to read.

        <h3>Week 6 - Design Section</h3>
        <p>
          This week, I am further finalising my design decisions for the
          website, including my colour palette, fonts, layout, and wireframes.
        </p>

        <h4>Style Guide:</h4>
        <h5>Goal & Aesthetic</h5>
        <p>
          My goal and aesthetic for my website remain the same, where I aim to
          showcase my portfolio in a simple yet engaging manner, making it easy
          for potential employers, collaborators, peers, and casual viewers to
          explore my work. The aesthetic is clean, modern, and minimalistic,
          ensuring the content is accessible and easy to navigate.
        </p>

        <h5>Visual Design Elements</h5>
        <h6>Colour Palette Refinement</h6>
        <p>
          I refined my colour palette and decided on my primary, secondary, and
          neutral colours. This refinement ensures a cohesive and well-balanced
          visual identity for my website.
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary colours provide strong contrast and readability; the
          neutral colours create a clean foundation; and the secondary colours
          add visual interest and highlight key elements. I included black in
          the palette.
        </p>

        <h6>Primary Colours:</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Black (#000000) – Strong contrast colour for text, icons, and key
            elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Delft Blue (#3C415B) – A deep, refined colour for the main
            background, headings, buttons, and key UI components.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Neutral Colours:</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            White (#FFFFFF) – Used for big headers to ensure clean contrast and
            readability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Almond (#E6DACE) – A warm, soft neutral for block/card backgrounds
            and subtle section dividers.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Secondary Colours (Accents):</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Ash Grey (#B2C7B6) – A muted green, good for highlights and soft
            interactive elements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cambridge Blue (#8DA69B) – Might also be used for card backgrounds
            or supporting elements like borders and hover effects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jasper (#B75B47) – A warm, contrasting colour used for numbering,
            emphasis, CTAs, or other supporting elements.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Font Choices and Updates</h5>
        <p>Fonts will be used as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Headings and Main Text:</strong> Poppins – A modern,
            sans-serif font for headings, subheadings, and other key text
            elements. It gives the website a clean, contemporary look.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Body Text:</strong> Tinos – A serif font chosen for its
            readability in longer passages, ensuring clarity and comfort when
            reading detailed content.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Navigation & Interface Elements</h5>
        <p>
          I’ve kept my navigation elements mostly the same and added some new
          additions for better navigation.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Buttons: Used for actions like “Read More”, “View”, and “Back to
            Top”.
          </li>
          <li>
            List Boxes: On the Blogs page, users can select a post from a list,
            and the page will scroll to it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sticky Navigation Bar: On the Home page, clicking a section (e.g.,
            Portfolio) will smoothly scroll to it. On other pages (Blog, Essay,
            Design Process, Portfolio), it will navigate to the respective page.
          </li>
          <li>Icons: Quick visual links for Contact info and GitHub.</li>
          <li>
            Breadcrumbs (New Addition): Helps users understand where they are
            and easily navigate back.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Accessibility Considerations</h5>
        <p>
          As part of my website’s accessibility improvements, I’ve made changes
          to ensure that all images have alternative text descriptions and that
          the navigation bar is keyboard accessible.
        </p>

        <h5>Feedback and Iteration</h5>
        <p>
          I’ve received feedback from a few friends and peers regarding the
          design and they mentioned that the button colours could be more
          prominent. I will adjust the hover effects and CTAs accordingly in the
          coming weeks.

          <li>
            <p>
              The Seth Hampton portfolio website is my main inspiration. It can
              be found
              <a href="https://sethhamptonportfolio.webflow.io/" target="_blank"
                >here</a
              >. I like the layout of the site. Initially, I wanted my website
              to look like this, all on one page. However, in the end I found it
              to be a little much. What I don’t like about it is when you’re on
              a section such as “about” or “resume”, you have to scroll through
              the entire section to be able to proceed to the next section of
              the webpage.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              I was also inspired by the Maya Nelson layout on Wix, which can be
              found
              <a
                href="https://www.wix.com/demone2/personal-resume/resume"
                target="_blank"
                >here</a
              >. I like the layout and design of the information in this
              example. It almost appears to be in the form of postcards that
              align in the centre of the page. What I don’t like, however, is
              the colour scheme. It’s a bit too bland. Initially, I thought it
              might be a somewhat soothing colour, but I want viewers to be
              energised and excited by my work, so I needed some colour that
              would be more active.

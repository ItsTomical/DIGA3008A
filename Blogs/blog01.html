          <h2>My experience setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages</h2>

          <p>
            Setting up GitHub and publishing to Pages was most definitely a
            learning experience. I would not have been able to publish to Pages
            (even with some prior knowledge of GitHub) were it not for the
            guide, which helped me set up the process. However, I must add that
            I also struggled with the guide at one point. So, my experience was
            that it was not as easy as I imagined it should be.

            Reflection on the readings you selected - relating it to your
            experience with the internet today
          </h2>

          <p>As We May Think - Bush, 1945</p>
          <p>
            When choosing to read As We May Think by Bush (1945), I initially
            struggled to understand its main focus. I had to go over it a few
            times to fully understand what Bush was saying. Eventually, I began
            to understand his ideas about technology and knowledge, especially
            his concept of the “Memex”, a system for storing and accessing
            information. He predicted a future with digital libraries, personal
            devices, and links between ideas. Today, I see these ideas reflected
            in platforms like Wikipedia (digital libraries), hyperlinks or
            hypertext (links between ideas), and devices like smartphones or
            computers (personal devices).
          </p>
          <p>
            Bush highlighted the problem of information overload, where the
            enormous amount of knowledge available makes it difficult to find
            information that is relevant to what you are looking for. I think
            this problem is more of an issue now than ever before, even with
            tools like Google and Wikipedia. This is because the internet is so
            vast and it can be overwhelming at times. I often experience this
            problem myself. For example, when searching for resources for an
            assignment, I find that finding relevant information can be a lot of
            work. It becomes even more difficult when the topic is niche, even
            though there is such a wealth of knowledge available.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bush also spoke about how machines would take over tasks and perform
            them at speeds that humans could not do manually, allowing us to
            focus more on creativity and problem solving rather than on the
            repetitive tasks. In today’s day and age, I think we can see Bush’s
            idea reflected in technologies like AI (such as ChatGPT) and search
            engines (like Google), and even smart assistants (like Siri), which
            help us process information faster and much more efficiently.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, Bush’s ideas from 1945 are still relevant today.
            Modern tools do more than just store information; they help us to
            organise, find, and use knowledge more easily, just as Bush
            imagined.

          <h2>History of the Web & A Little History of the World Wide Web :</h2>

          <p>
            Reading about The History of the Web and A Little History of the
            World Wide Web, looking at the timeline, I realise how much the
            internet has changed from then to now. From starting as text-based
            systems where people had to look for information manually, often
            using books or encyclopedias, to the creation of the World Wide Web
            by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, and the development of the first browser
            by Mosaic in 1993. Now I feel as we begin making our own websites,
            it starts off like this, text-based and then gradually improving it
            with visuals, etc.

          <h2>Interesting things I have learned about the web</h2>

          <p>
            What I find interesting about the history of the internet is how
            much the internet has changed over time from being so text-based. It
            is easy to forget that the internet we use today, with all its
            images, videos and interactive features, did not start like that. At
            first, everything focused on text and sharing basic information. I
            understand that websites were more like digital libraries, and it
            took a lot of time and effort to find what you were looking for. But
            as new technologies like the World Wide Web and web browsers were
            developed, we have been able to add links, images, and videos,
            changing how we use and experience information. This has made the
            internet much easier to use. What I also find interesting is that
            this way of sharing information was predicted in 1945 by Vannevar
            Bush, who imagined a system where information was linked together.
            The internet today is much more exciting, and it shapes our lives,
            from how we communicate to how we work and entertain ourselves.

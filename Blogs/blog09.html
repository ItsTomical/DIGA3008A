            A critical response to Daniolou, Costanza-Chock, and Cantrill that
            argues internet access is a basic right—and that ethical, inclusive
            design must centre the voices of those most affected by digital
            exclusion.

          <h2>Access to the Internet as a Basic Right</h2>
          <p>
            Access to the internet is no longer something extra; it’s something
            people need to live and work in today’s world. In her article,
            <em>The Need for Global Internet Connectivity</em>, Claire Daniolou
            explains that not having internet can lead to being left out
            socially, having less opportunities to earn money, and struggling to
            get education and healthcare, especially in rural areas. I agree
            that internet access should be treated as a basic right. Without it,
            people are cut off from many of the things that others rely on every
            day. But people also need to know how to use the internet in useful
            and safe ways. To close the digital divide, we need to invest in
            building infrastructure and also in teaching digital skills. If we
            want a more equal and connected world, we have to make sure no one
            is left behind.

          <h2>Design Justice and Inclusive Design</h2>
          <p>
            This idea of including everyone links closely to the concept of
            design justice. Sasha Costanza-Chock writes in
            <em
              >Design Justice: Community-Led Practices to Build the World We
              Need</em
            >
            that design is often seen as a way to fix problems or make things
            more efficient. But design is not neutral; it is shaped by power and
            affects who gets included and who is left out. Design justice
            recognises that people with more privilege and influence often
            control how things are designed, which can lead to unfair results.
            Design choices, whether on a digital platform or in a physical
            space, can increase inequality by limiting access for some groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we want a fairer society, we have to look at who holds the power
            in the design process and try to change that. Design justice tells
            us that people who are most affected by a problem should be the ones
            helping to create the solution. This ensures the design process is
            fair, inclusive, and meets the needs of everyone, not just those who
            already have power. I agree with this approach. When communities are
            left out of the design process, the result is systems that don’t
            meet their needs or even make things worse. To build a society that
            is fair, we need to share the power in design and include the people
            most affected so that the process works for everyone and they can
            trust it.
          </p>

          <h2>Ethical Design and Community-Led Projects</h2>
          <p>
            I support how design justice values local, community-led projects.
            The tech world is obsessed with growing things fast and reaching the
            biggest audience possible. But small and slow can be better,
            especially when it means building trust and creating something that
            actually works for people. This connects to Bryan Cantrill’s talk on
            ethical dilemmas in software. He points out that engineers are
            shaping society but don’t always think about ethics. That’s why
            design justice matters. It puts fairness and accountability at the
            centre of the process. Ethical design means thinking about what’s
            right, not just what’s possible. It should work well and also
            respect the needs of the people using it.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my opinion, design justice is the direction we need to go. If we
            want more inclusive and ethical systems, we have to design with and
            not just for the people most affected.

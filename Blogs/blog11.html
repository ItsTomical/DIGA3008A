            Reflecting on Robinson et al. (2015), this blog explores how digital
            inequality goes beyond access, affecting how people engage with
            technology across age, gender, and geography. It argues that true
            digital inclusion requires not just devices, but confidence, skills,
            and meaningful support.

        <h2>Understanding digital inequality</h2>
        <section>
          <p>
            In this week’s reading, Digital Inequalities and Why They Matter,
            Robinson et al. (2015) explain that digital inequality isn’t just
            about who has a computer or internet access. It’s also about how
            people use technology, whether they feel comfortable with it, and
            what they can actually do online. They show that digital inequality
            is tied to other forms of inequality, like age, gender, race and
            income, and can make those problems even worse.
          </p>

          <h2>Capability matters</h2>
          <p>
            Robinson et al. (2015) tell us that having internet access isn’t
            enough; what really matters is knowing how to use it and feeling at
            ease in engaging with it. It made me think of when I’ve seen people
            struggle, not because they didn’t own a phone or a laptop, but
            because they weren’t sure how to use them or were hesitant to ask
            for help.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Age and the digital divide</h2>
          <p>
            A point they raise is how digital inequality affects people of
            different ages differently. For example, some school students might
            have to share a device at home and so have little time online,
            “often depriving them of opportunities to develop the kinds of
            valuable web skills which their less constrained peers enjoy”
            (Robinson et al., 2015, p.571). It got me thinking about how, in
            some homes, children have to take turns using one device, which
            means less time for classes, assignments, or even just asking for
            help when they’re stuck. Meanwhile, older adults might avoid using
            technology altogether because they find it confusing. I’ve seen this
            in real life. For older people, even basic apps can be overwhelming
            without support. My 86-year-old gran, for example, often asks me to
            help her sort out the apps on her phone because she finds them
            confusing. This shows how something as everyday as using a
            smartphone can be difficult if you’re not confident or haven’t had
            much experience with digital tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            The digital divide also shows up in the lives of middle-aged adults,
            who Robinson et al. (2015) say often care for both children and
            elderly parents. As they put it, “for those who can make effective
            use of digital resources during this life stage, caretaking burdens
            can be eased” (Robinson et al., 2015, p.572). This reminds me of my
            neighbour, who set up a digital camera to monitor her elderly mother
            who lived thousands of kilometres away. When her mother fell and
            broke her hip, the camera’s two-way audio allowed my neighbour to
            speak to her and call for help quickly. In that moment, the camera
            wasn’t just a tool; it was what made it possible for her to act fast
            and prevent further harm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stories like this show how powerful digital tools can be when people
            have access to them and know how to use them. But they also make it
            clear how tough things can be for people who don’t have the same
            resources. If you don’t have the finances, don’t know where to start
            with technology, or aren’t comfortable using it, it’s much harder to
            care for someone from a distance or to just stay connected. I wonder
            then, if these digital tools can ease burdens and even save lives,
            shouldn’t governments step in to make sure everyone has the
            necessary access, training and support?

          <h2>Gender and technology</h2>
          <p>
            Digital inequality doesn’t just show up in who has access or how old
            someone is; it also shows up in how gender plays out online. One
            example that stuck with me from the reading was a study where people
            created avatars in virtual environments and often exaggerated
            traditional gender traits. Robinson et al. (2015, p.573) mention
            that “the gender stereotyping present in the offline world can
            appear in exaggerated forms in online environments”. It struck me
            how male characters are often made to look tough or in control,
            while female ones come across as softer or more passive. We like to
            think of digital spaces as more open or progressive, but they can
            end up repeating the same old gender stereotypes we see offline.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, are these digital spaces really as liberating as we think?
            Without thoughtful design and awareness, they can easily end up
            repeating old patterns. Reading this made me realise how important
            it is to build online environments that actually support equality,
            where people aren’t boxed in by outdated gender roles, but feel free
            to be themselves.

          <h2>A global perspective on digital inequality</h2>
          <p>
            This reading really made me think about how global digital
            inequality is. We often hear that the internet is “borderless”, but
            that’s not the reality for everyone. In many places, especially
            across parts of Africa, whole communities are still offline.
            Robinson et al. (2015) point out that “from a global perspective,
            digital inequalities often augment racial and ethnic disparities...
            in the case of Africa, global digital inequalities have reinforced
            existing racial as well as economic chasms, shutting out a huge
            proportion of the continent from access to the internet.” In some
            homes, children don’t even have their own device, which makes it
            nearly impossible to keep up in a world that assumes everyone is
            always connected. This makes me wonder how many students fell behind
            during the COVID-19 pandemic because they didn’t have the necessary
            technology. The pandemic highlighted how digital access is tied to
            education, work, healthcare, and even basic connection. Those
            without the right tools or skills were left behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            What stood out to me most, though, was the reminder that digital
            exclusion isn’t just a problem in poor or remote places. Robinson et
            al. (2015) show that it exists in wealthier countries too, just in
            different ways. I’ve started noticing it more: people who have
            devices but don’t feel confident using them, or who avoid certain
            tasks because they’re too confusing or frustrating.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>At the heart of it, for me</h2>
          <p>
            What really struck me in this reading is how it calls on all of us
            to care about digital inequality. Today, so much of our lives happen
            online. When you are digitally excluded, you’re not just missing out
            on the latest technology; you’re being left out of essential parts
            of society, like work, education, and social connections. This
            reading helped me to see that digital inequality is more than a
            technology issue; it’s a social issue with real consequences for
            people’s everyday lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's also made me aware of the hidden barriers people face online.
            This is not just about owning a device or being online. It’s about
            having confidence and skills to engage meaningfully with technology.
            Solving digital inequality then isn’t just about getting people
            online; it’s about ensuring we all have the support and tools to
            fully participate in the digital world.

            Reflecting on Verdi (2020) and Mohamed et al. (2020), this blog
            explores the ethical dimensions of web development through a
            decolonial lens. It considers how seemingly neutral design choices
            can reproduce systems of exclusion and highlights the tension
            between sleek interaction design and broad accessibility.

        <h2>Decolonialism: How code matters</h2>

        <section>
          <p>
            In building my website, I have come to realise that my coding
            decisions have deeper ethical implications, especially when viewed
            in the context of decolonialism. Verdi (2020) introduces the concept
            of techno-colonialism, where technology, particularly AI, is used by
            more powerful regions to maintain control over less powerful ones,
            creating systems of dependence. In the same way, my website could
            reflect power dynamics that benefit some users while leaving out
            others.

            Mohamed et al. (2020) highlight that digital systems aren't as
            neutral as they might seem. They’re shaped by the values and
            assumptions of the people who create them, and this means they can
            unintentionally exclude certain groups. Most of the time, global
            technologies end up prioritising Western languages, cultural norms,
            and design choices, making them less accessible or relevant to users
            from other contexts. It’s something that even a simple website can
            reveal, especially when it assumes everyone has access to fast
            internet, the latest gadgets, or specific tech skills.

            This got me thinking about my coding choices. I’ve added a few
            JavaScript features to my homepage that I think make the site easier
            to use and navigate. For example, the sticky navigation bar helps
            users jump easily between sections without reloading the page or
            having to scroll back to the top. I also included a carousel so
            people can view all my blog posts without leaving the homepage. And
            on the portfolio page, I set up a lightbox so clicking on an image
            brings it up in a larger format with context, without taking you
            away from the page. These changes are meant to make browsing my site
            feel more interactive and fun.
          </p>

            However, as Mohamed et al. (2020) point out, even well-intentioned
            design choices can create inequality. It made me think that by using
            a lot of JavaScript, I might be excluding people who have older
            devices, slow internet, or who need screen readers. This is part of
            what they call algorithmic colonialism, where digital systems embed
            power dynamics by privileging certain users while disadvantaging
            others. Verdi (2020) makes a similar point with data colonialism,
            where powerful regions extract data from others without giving much
            back. A website can do something similar if it assumes everyone has
            equal access to technology.

            Thinking about this, I realise how the issues Mohamed et al. (2020)
            raise about power and bias in tech can show up in web design too.
            Just like how AI might seem neutral but actually reflects its
            creators’ biases, my website could be doing the same. By focusing on
            smooth animations and interactive features, I might make the site
            look great, but not everyone will be able to enjoy it. I need to
            remember who might get left behind.

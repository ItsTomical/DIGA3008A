            Reflecting on the Values at Play framework, this post explores how I
            want to build ethical, inclusive, and justice-oriented
            systems—whether in code or creativity. It’s about asking hard
            questions, designing with intention, and listening deeply to those
            impacted.

        <h2>Justice, Ethics, and How I Want to Build Things Differently</h2>
        <section>
          <p>
            Whenever I think about justice and ethics in the things I create,
            whether it’s coding a project or making art, I always come back to
            one idea: what we create says a lot about what we believe. Every
            choice we make, big or small, shows our values. So even if we don’t
            mean to send a message, one still comes through. That’s why I try to
            be intentional. I don’t just want to make things that work; I want
            to make things that feel like they belong in the fair, inclusive,
            and creative world I’m hoping for.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing that really stood out to me is the Values at Play (VAP)
            framework by Flanagan and Nissenbaum (2005). It’s a way of designing
            that helps people build in values like justice, equity, and
            inclusion from the very beginning, not as an afterthought.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Start with values</h2>
          <p>
            The first step in the method is about discovery – figuring out what
            really matters. What values should guide the work you’re creating?
            That means asking questions either about your own experiences or
            about the people you’re designing for. Say I’m making something
            around AI or identity; I’d want to think about fairness,
            representation and transparency. So my questions would be: What’s at
            stake? Who’s included? Who might be left out? These questions will
            shape everything that follows.
          </p>
          <p>
            The VAP method reminds me to think about everyone involved; not just
            what I care about, but about what matters to the people using what I
            make, the team I am working with, and the world it will live in.
            Design doesn’t happen in a bubble, and if I’m not careful, I could
            end up repeating the same problems I’m trying to solve. That
            connects with something Zulfikar et al. (2023) talk about: how
            designers aren’t just responsible to users, but to society as a
            whole. Their point is that ethical design means owning the impact of
            your work, instead of pretending that technology is neutral. This
            reminds me that creating something isn’t just a technical task; it’s
            also social, political, and personal.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Designing with intention</h2>
          <p>
            Step two in the VAP method is where things get creative and the big
            ideas start to take shape. It’s about turning things like fairness
            or teamwork into real features people can use. A fun example is
            co-op mode in games like Overcooked or It Takes Two. These games are
            built around teamwork. You literally can’t more forward unless you
            work together. The design rewards communication, coordination, and
            solving problems as a team, instead of letting one person carry the
            game. It shows how collaboration can be built into the system
            itself. In my own work, that could mean designing for teamwork
            instead of just competition, giving people the freedom to be
            creative, and making sure that what I build is truly accessible –
            not just in how it works but in how it makes people feel included.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don’t believe it’s always easy. Sometimes values clash, and you
            have to fight for the features that matter most. But I think the
            best ideas come from those challenging moments.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Reflection and responsibility</h2>
          <p>
            Step three is all about asking: did this actually work? Just because
            I had good intentions doesn’t mean the result reflects that. That’s
            why testing and feedback are so important; not just to catch bugs,
            but to check that the values I was aiming for are coming through.
            Flanagan and Nissenbaum talk about surveys, playtesting, interviews,
            even tracking how people behave in-game to understand their real
            response. In other words: don’t guess. Ask people for their
            feedback, and listen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, I don’t think ethical design is about being perfect.
            It’s about being present, caring, open to learning, and building
            systems that respect people, not just serve them. If we don’t focus
            on justice, we’ll just repeat the same mistakes. And I’d rather help
            create something different.

          <p>
            My goal for my website is to develop a platform where I can showcase
            my portfolio of work in a simple yet engaging manner, attracting a
            variety of users, including potential employers, collaborators and
            peers, as well as casual viewers, such as family and friends.

          <p>
            I want users of my website to easily view and explore my work,

            spark their interest in what I have to offer and for them to act by
            reaching out to me for feedback, employment or collaboration.

            <h3>Interface Elements</h3>
          </header>

          <header>
            <h4>Buttons:</h4>
          </header>
          <p>
            I'll use buttons like “Read More” and “View” to guide visitors
            towards engaging with my content. These will appear on the homepage
            under the short descriptions for the blogs, essays, portfolio, and
            the design process. There will also be a “Back to Top” at the bottom
            of the blog and essay pages.
          </p>

          <header>
            <h4>List Boxes:</h4>
          </header>
          <p>
            On the blogs page, I'll implement a list box that allows users to
            select the specific blog they want to see. When they select a blog
            from the list, the page will scroll down to that particular post,
            giving them easy access to the content. Once they’ve found the post,
            they can click “Read More” to read the full blog.
          </p>

          <header>
            <h4>Sticky Navigation Bar:</h4>
          </header>
          <p>
            To ensure easy access to all sections of the website, I’ll use a
            sticky navigation bar that remains visible as the user scrolls.
          </p>

          <header>
            <h4>Icons:</h4>
          </header>
          <p>
            I'll use icons for quick visual references to links like my Contact
            information and Github.

            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
          </header>
          <p>
            My original wireframes have changed a lot in these second
            renditions. While the style and layout remain the same, the major
            change comes in here: I had originally thought of having everything
            on my home page, and the user clicks on what they want to view, and
            the page expands to open up the selected content. Now, when the user
            clicks on the content on the home page, it will take them to a new
            page (for example, the blogs page), which I believe makes for better
            flow and user experience.

            <h3>Style Guide</h3>
          </header>

          <header>
            <h4>Visual Aesthetic:</h4>
          </header>
          <p>
            My website will have a simple, clean, and modern design. The focus
            will be on ensuring the content is easy to read and view, with a
            balance of text and images to improve the experience. The design
            will be easy to navigate, with no distractions, helping users to
            easily find what they need.
          </p>

          <header>
            <h4>Colour Scheme:</h4>
          </header>
          <p>
            I’ll use a simple colour scheme with neutral colours like white or
            light beige for the background, and accent colours like blue or
            green for buttons, links, and important words. This will help
            organise the page and make it easier for users to find their way.
          </p>

          <header>
            <h4>Layout:</h4>
          </header>
          <p>
            The layout will be neat and organised, using a grid system to keep
            everything in place. There will be enough space between elements to
            avoid clutter and make the site easy to read. Important features,
            like the navigation bar and buttons, will be easy to find.
          </p>

          <header>
            <h4>Font Choices:</h4>
          </header>
          <p>
            For headings, I’ll use Poppins, a modern, clean font that’s easy to
            read. For body text, I’ll use Georgia, a classic serif font that’s
            great for longer reading passages. The font sizes will follow a
            clear structure to guide users through the headings, subheadings,
            and body content.
          </p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
          </header>
          <p>
            In terms of struggles, I found it frustrating that when committing
            and pushing a change, it takes a long time to appear on the website.
            I didn’t realise this and so I went back to edit the code because I
            thought something was wrong. However, I actually didn’t need to do
            this; I just needed to wait a bit longer. <br />
            Additionally, I have struggled with image placement, and will need
            to work on this. I need to get my website to a point where I am
            happy with the HTML and semantic markup before we start CSS and Java
            Script.
            <br />
            I am happy with and proud of the file structure on my site. I feel
            that all it needs is a bit of refinement as I progress through the
            development of the site.

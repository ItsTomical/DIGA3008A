            <h2>
              User Alignment and Mapping Site Content, Experience, and Interface
              Elements
            </h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            The Interaction Design slides describe alignment as having a clear
            goal, ensuring things are easy to do, and communicating well. The
            main goal in designing my website is to showcase my work in a
            simple, engaging manner. My focus will be on making the site easy to
            use and meeting the needs of different visitors (also known as
            “actors”). These will include casual viewers (such as family and
            friends), peers, lecturers/tutors, and potential employers or
            collaborators.
          </p>

          <p>
            According to the slides, interaction happens when something responds
            to a user’s actions in a meaningful (not random) way, requires
            effort, and leads to a change. On my website, I want visitors to
            interact with my portfolio by clicking on a piece to see more
            details, context, and images. In the same way, on my blog and essay
            pages, users will see a heading and a short preview (or teaser) of
            each post. If they want to read more, they can click to access the
            full ßpost. My aim is for this design to encourage exploration, and
            I plan to link posts about my design process to guide my visitors
            toward related topics.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another key point from the slides is that interfaces work as systems
            of signs, with a signifier (what you see) and a signified (its
            meaning or function). For example, a hyperlink’s visible text is the
            signifier, while its purpose (which is to take the user to another
            page) is the signified. I plan to apply this concept to my website
            by using portfolio thumbnails or description text as signifiers,
            leading my visitors to more information.
          </p>

          <p>
            The slides also describe users as actors because they actively shape
            their experience through interaction. On my site, their actions –
            such as filtering portfolio pieces by category – will influence
            their journey, making navigation more personalised.
          </p>

          <p>
            The slides highlight three key areas in interaction design:
            Information Architecture (IA), User Experience (UX), and User
            Interface (UI). IA is all about organising content so users can find
            what they need easily.
          </p>

          <p>
            IA is about organising content so users can easily find what they
            are looking for. For my site, I plan to have six main sections:
            Home, Blogs, Essays, Portfolio, Design, and About, with a sticky
            navigation bar at the top for easy access. Everything will be
            structured in a way that makes sense and is usable. To help visitors
            find what they’re looking for, I will categorise my portfolio by
            project type and provide headings and short teasers for blog posts
            to allow them to scan through the topics. I will also link related
            content. By organising information clearly and providing links, I
            aim to make it easy for visitors to find what interests them.
          </p>

          <p>
            UX is about making my website easy and enjoyable to use. I want
            visitors to smoothly move through the site, starting from the Home
            page, going to the About section to learn more about me, then
            exploring the work in my Portfolio, and finally checking out the
            Blogs and Essays for more insights.
          </p>

          <p>
            UI is about how the website looks and how “actors” interact with it.
            As mentioned above, I plan to use a sticky navigation bar for easy
            access. I would also like to use breadcrumbs to show users where
            they are, and links to connect related content. Additionally, I
            would like to include buttons like “Read More” under blog previews
            and “View Portfolio” to guide users. On the Portfolio page, users
            will be able to filter projects by category to find relevant work.
            These elements will make the site visually appealing and easy to
            use.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <header>
            <h2>
              Reflecting on Structure, URL Scheme, and the Role of Semantic
              Markup
            </h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            One of the key points from the slides is that a well-organised site
            helps both users and systems. That's why I will set up my URLs to be
            clear and easy to follow. For example, my site will use simple URLs
            like:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>DIGA3008A/home</li>
            <li>DIGA3008A/blogs</li>
            <li>Blogs/Week 1</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This will help users to know where they are on the site. I also
            intend to use semantic HTML elements like &lt article &gt, &lt nav
            &gt, &lt section &gt, and &lt footer &gt to make the site more
            accessible and search-engine friendly. Using proper HTML tags will
            ensure my content is well-structured and meaningful. These elements
            will help improve navigation, boost search engine optimisation
            (SEO), and make the site easier to update in the future.

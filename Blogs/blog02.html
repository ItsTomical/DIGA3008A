        <h2>How does it speak to the internet today?</h2>

        <p>
          Moulthrop (1993) suggests that hypertext wouldn’t replace books, but
          would change how we engage with media. This is true today – while
          books continue to exist, the internet involves much more interactivity
          than mere reading. Moulthrop (1993) reflects on Nelson’s vision of
          hypertext, and his system called Xanadu. Nelson saw hypertext as a
          “return of literacy” (Moulthrop, 1993, p.695), a way for people to
          explore ideas beyond books and create information instead of just
          reading it. He believed literacy was only for the elite, limiting
          access to knowledge. His vision for Xanadu was of a network that
          allowed users to “manipulate and alter the textual corpus” (Moulthrop,
          1993, p.692); where they could control the information themselves
          rather than leaving it to companies or governments to decide what gets
          shared.
        </p>

        <p>
          But Moulthrop (1993) warns that hypertext could still be taken over by
          gatekeeping forces. This is exactly what we see today, with the web
          largely controlled by a few big tech companies. Most people use
          platforms like Facebook, X or Google to get their news, but what they
          find is information shaped by algorithms that determine what they see.
          Also, think of the political control in China, where citizens’ access
          is restricted by the Great Firewall, which blocks sites like Google,
          Wikipedia and many more.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, instead of the open web that Nelson imagined, companies and
          governments today control what information we see online. While the
          internet lets us create videos, share opinions, and post blogs (like
          this one), participation is still limited and controlled. Social media
          companies decide what content gets seen and what gets ignored. Even
          though people create content, businesses and governments still control
          what is shared and what is hidden to suit their interests.
        </p>

        <p>
          Moulthrop (1993) also talks about “secondary literacy”, where people
          don’t just use hypertext, but actually understand how it works. Nelson
          saw hypertext as a way to get more people involved with information so
          that they could think more critically. He imagined that everyone would
          have a basic understanding of it. This is not the case today. It is
          true that the internet has made it easier to create and share content,
          but not everyone knows how it works. Most of us just consume content
          and don’t have the power to shape it or control what we see. So, we
          end up following what companies decide we should see.
        </p>

        <p>
          In conclusion, Moulthrop’s (1993) idea of a hypertext revolution
          hasn’t fully come to life. While the internet has made communication
          more interactive, its potential is held back by corporate and
          political control influence, algorithms, and unequal access to digital
          skills. Nelson’s dream of Xanadu as a free and open system for sharing
          information hasn’t come true. So we have to ask the question, can the
          internet still become the knowledge-sharing place Nelson had hoped
          for, or has it become just another tool for those in power?

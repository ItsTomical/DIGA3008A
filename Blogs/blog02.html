            A reflection on Moulthrop’s and Nelson’s visions of a free, open
            internet — and how today’s web, shaped by algorithms, corporations,
            and governments, challenges the dream of true digital literacy and
            user control.

        <section>
          <h2>Moulthrop’s vision and the web we have today</h2>
          <p>
            Moulthrop (1993) suggests that hypertext wouldn’t replace books, but
            would change how we engage with media. This is true today – while
            books continue to exist, the internet involves much more
            interactivity than mere reading. Moulthrop (1993) reflects on
            Nelson’s vision of hypertext, and his system called Xanadu. Nelson
            saw hypertext as a “return of literacy” (Moulthrop, 1993, p.695), a
            way for people to explore ideas beyond books and create information
            instead of just reading it.
          </p>
          <p>
            He believed literacy was only for the elite, limiting access to
            knowledge. His vision for Xanadu was of a network that allowed users
            to “manipulate and alter the textual corpus” (Moulthrop, 1993,
            p.692); where they could control the information themselves rather
            than leaving it to companies or governments to decide what gets
            shared.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Corporate and political control</h2>
          <p>
            Moulthrop (1993) warns that hypertext could still be taken over by
            gatekeeping forces. This is exactly what we see today, with the web
            largely controlled by a few big tech companies. Most people use
            platforms like Facebook, X or Google to get their news, but what
            they find is information shaped by algorithms that determine what
            they see.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, think of the political control in China, where citizens’
            access is restricted by the Great Firewall, which blocks sites like
            Google, Wikipedia and many more.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Is the web really participatory?</h2>
          <p>
            Instead of the open web that Nelson imagined, companies and
            governments today control what information we see online. While the
            internet lets us create videos, share opinions, and post blogs (like
            this one), participation is still limited and controlled. Social
            media companies decide what content gets seen and what gets ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though people create content, businesses and governments still
            control what is shared and what is hidden to suit their interests.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Secondary literacy and the missing layer of understanding</h2>
          <p>
            Moulthrop (1993) also talks about “secondary literacy”, where people
            don’t just use hypertext, but actually understand how it works.
            Nelson saw hypertext as a way to get more people involved with
            information so that they could think more critically.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is not the case today. It is true that the internet has made it
            easier to create and share content, but not everyone knows how it
            works. Most of us just consume content and don’t have the power to
            shape it or control what we see. So, we end up following what
            companies decide we should see.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Moulthrop’s (1993) idea of a hypertext revolution hasn’t fully come
            to life. While the internet has made communication more interactive,
            its potential is held back by corporate and political control,
            algorithms, and unequal access to digital skills. Nelson’s dream of
            Xanadu as a free and open system for sharing information hasn’t come
            true.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we have to ask the question, can the internet still become the
            knowledge-sharing place Nelson had hoped for, or has it become just
            another tool for those in power?

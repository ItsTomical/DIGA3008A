          <h2>How Geography Shapes – and Is Shaped by – the Internet</h2>
          <p>
            People said the internet would make geography irrelevant. That we
            would all be able to work from anywhere, shop from anywhere, and
            connect globally without any barriers. But it seems a bit more
            complicated than that.
          </p>
          <p>
            In “How Geography Shapes – and Is Shaped by – the Internet”,
            Greenstein, Forman and Goldfarb (2018) argue that instead of erasing
            geography, the internet has often deepened divides and reinforced
            the importance of place. It’s not that the internet doesn’t reduce
            barriers. It does! But the benefits really aren’t shared equally.
          </p>
          <h2>
            So, how does geography still play a role in our digital lives?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Greenstein et al. (2018) wanted to understand how the internet
            changes economic opportunities, and whether it actually frees people
            from the old limits of location. Their argument revolved around the
            idea that the internet helps reduce three problems in the economy:
            Communication costs; transportation costs; and search costs (finding
            what you need faster online). Yet cutting these costs doesn’t help
            everyone equally because they depend on things like local
            infrastructure, talent, and resources – and some places just have
            more of those than others. So, instead of the internet erasing
            geography, it has actually ended up reinforcing it.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>How did they study it?</h2>
          <p>
            Greenstein et al. (2018) gathered insights from existing studies to
            put together a comprehensive literature review. They explored
            research in economics, urban studies, and information systems,
            identifying themes on how the internet shapes connections between
            people and places. These include the death of distance, who’s
            adopting the internet, economic consequences, innovation, consumer
            behaviour, and global trade. They mix case studies, models, and
            theory, tying their research to real-world data.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What did they find?</h2>
          <h3>The death of distance?</h3>
          <p>
            The internet has made it easier and cheaper to communicate from a
            distance, but it hasn’t made geography irrelevant like some people
            once thought. According to Greenstein et al. (2018), digital tools
            can replace some types of communication, transportation, and search,
            but they can’t replace everything. Face-to-face communication is
            still really important, especially when it comes to sharing more
            complicated information. At first, people thought the internet would
            make cities less important by cutting down the need for in-person
            connections and transport. But they have become even more important.
            Big cities with plenty of skilled workers and businesses are in a
            much better position to take advantage of digital tools. Meanwhile,
            rural areas, where the right infrastructure often isn’t available,
            are being left behind.
          </p>

          <h3>Who’s adopting it?</h3>
          <p>
            In big cities, it’s easier to keep up with new technology. Fast
            internet, skilled workers, and a culture that quickly embraces new
            tools all help. When you’re surrounded by people using the latest
            technology, it’s easier to get on board. In rural areas, things are
            a bit different. While the internet could help connect these places
            to bigger markets, many don’t have things like fast internet,
            skilled workers, or the support services they need. Because of this,
            businesses have a harder time trying to compete. It’s the same for
            individuals too. Wealthier, better educated, and younger people
            adopt new technology faster.
          </p>

          <h3>Economic gains are unequal:</h3>
          <p>
            The internet isn’t closing the gap between rich and poor; it’s often
            making it worse. Greenstein et al. (2018) shared a study that found
            that only a small number of U.S. counties (6%) got most of the
            economic benefits from internet investments. Most of the income
            growth happened in already wealthy areas, while poorer regions were
            left behind. Instead of closing the gap, the internet actually made
            inequality worse in some places. They call this the “pay-off puzzle”
            (Greenstein et al., 2018, p.6).
          </p>

          <h3>Innovation:</h3>
          <p>
            The internet has made it easier for scientists to work together,
            even if they’re at different universities or cities. However,
            innovation still isn’t spreading as widely as expected. While the
            internet can reduce the concentration of innovation in some areas,
            it can also lead to “balkanization” (Greenstein et al., 2018, p.8),
            where people stick to collaborating with similar groups. So, even
            with more opportunities for collaboration, innovation still tends to
            be concentrated in a few big, well-connected places, especially
            where there’s heavy investment in digital tools.
          </p>

          <h3>Local matters:</h3>
          <p>
            The internet helps people overcome distance, especially when it
            comes to getting better deals or accessing products they couldn’t
            find locally, but where you live still shapes how you behave online.
            People often visit websites from businesses close to home, because a
            lot of online content is still local and so are our tastes. We’re
            drawn to things that feel familiar and reflect where we’re from. So
            where you live still shapes what you click on, watch, and buy.
          </p>

          <h3>Global trade:</h3>
          <p>
            The internet was expected to make global trade easy, but in practice
            it mostly strengthens domestic business relationships. Digital tools
            help coordinate across distances, but trust, culture, and legal
            systems still matter a lot when it comes to international trade.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What do I think?</h2>
          <p>
            In my view, the idea that the internet will erase the importance of
            distance is unrealistic without serious investment in rural areas.
            Greenstein et al. (2018) show that geography still matters, but
            their research points to a bigger issue: Without proper action,
            technology won’t close the gap; it will make it worse. As they note,
            “Despite the promise of a death of distance, the internet has thus
            far exacerbated differences in income across locations” (Greenstein
            et al., 2018, p.12). Charlesworth (2024) also highlights how rural
            areas are left behind because of poor infrastructure, lack of
            skills, and limited support. Rather than helping, the promise of
            connectivity often deepens inequalities.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s clear to me that simply having access to technology isn’t
            enough. Awati and Hanna (2024) agree, stressing that the digital
            divide is not just about access. It’s about affordability, local
            relevance, and digital literacy, which can further widen the gap.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s also a reminder that you can’t just throw technology at
            deep-rooted problems and believe they will go away. If we don’t
            tackle the real causes of inequality, the digital divide will only
            get worse. Technology is often expected to help fix inequality, but
            that doesn’t always happen. If we don’t deal with the deeper issues
            like access, education, and infrastructure, it can actually end up
            reinforcing the same power imbalances it was supposed to challenge.

        <section>
          <h2>My ideas for future research</h2>
          <p>
            One thing that really stood out to me was how important
            complementary factors like infrastructure and skills are when it
            comes to benefiting from the internet. I feel though that the
            chapter could’ve gone further into exploring who controls digital
            infrastructure, since things like telecom monopolies, platform power
            (like Google or Amazon), and regulations all influence how internet
            access is distributed and who gets to use it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, Greenstein et al. (2018) focus mostly on the economic
            geography side, but there’s a bigger social justice angle that I
            think is worth exploring too. Kasapis (2020) reminds us that
            internet access is a basic human right. Thinking about it this way
            raises bigger questions about fairness and who gets left behind.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>So, does the internet make place less important?</h2>
          <p>
            Not really. You can work from anywhere, shop from anywhere, and chat
            with people all over the world. But, where you live still plays a
            big role. The internet changes how we do things but it doesn’t erase
            the benefits of being geographically close. Greenstein et al. (2018)
            show while the internet has changed a lot about how we live and
            work, it hasn’t made everything equal. People in cities with good
            infrastructure and fast internet benefit more, while others are left
            behind. So no, the internet hasn’t made geography irrelevant; it’s
            just changed how it matters. It still shapes what kind of access,
            opportunities, and digital experiences you actually get.
          </p>
          <p>
            That doesn’t mean technology is the problem. It means we need to
            think more carefully about how we use it and who it’s actually
            benefiting. Simply giving people internet access isn’t enough. We
            need to make sure it’s affordable, that people know how to use it,
            and that the right infrastructure is there.
          </p>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Today, websites are a big part of how we connect with services and
            information. The way a website looks (user interface or UI) and how
            easy it is to use (user experience or UX) shape our experience
            online. These design choices don’t just affect how we move around a
            site, they also raise important ethical issues such as fairness,
            privacy, and accessibility. Effective interaction design directly
            influences the level of trust and control users feel when using a
            website. As Mok (2025) states, “Trust is the invisible foundation of
            every great user experience.”
          </p>
          <p>
            This essay explores the UI, UX, and ethical challenges of the South
            African National Parks (SANParks) website, which plays a crucial
            role in tourism, education, and conservation in South Africa. It
            looks at how the website works, how its UI and UX affect usability,
            and whether its design follows ethical web standards such as
            accessibility, transparency, and empowering users. At its core,
            ethical UX means designing with the user’s best interests in mind:
            protecting privacy, supporting informed choices, and creating
            respectful, inclusive digital experiences (Mok, 2023).
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            The SANParks website was updated in 2023 (SANParks, 2025, p.25),
            with clear improvements in how it looks and works. The changes were
            made to better serve different types of users, especially tourists
            and people interested in nature and conservation.
          </p>
          <p>
            SANParks, which stands for South African National Parks, is a public
            entity responsible for managing 21 national parks across South
            Africa. It plays a key role in protecting the country’s biodiversity
            and supporting sustainable tourism (SANParks, 2025). The SANParks
            website is an important tool that provides the public with easy
            access to information about the parks, allows for booking
            accommodation and activities, and promotes responsible tourism
            practices. It serves as a digital link between the government, local
            communities, and both domestic and international visitors (SANParks,
            2025). As a public entity, SANParks has a duty to serve the public
            interest, making the ethical design of its website particularly
            important. National parks help promote shared heritage, support
            rural development, and protect natural and cultural resources
            (SANParks, 2025). Because the SANParks website connects people to
            these public benefits, its website must deliver services effectively
            and support inclusive, user-friendly interaction.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>UI and UX: Structure, Navigation, and Experience</h2>
          <p>
            The SANParks website is a good example of how a thoughtfully
            designed UI and UX can work together to create a site that is easy
            to use, works well, and keeps people engaged. Since it connects the
            public with a national conservation body, the website is designed to
            reflect the organisation’s goals and values.
          </p>
          <p>
            The UI is visually clean, consistent, and aligns with SANParks’
            brand as a conservation authority. It uses a natural colour palette,
            with earth tones such as green, orange and brown reinforcing the
            site’s environmental theme and setting a nature-focused tone.
            High-quality images of landscapes, wildlife, and parks are used
            throughout the site, making it visually appealing and adding
            emotional and contextual depth. This combination of colour, imagery,
            and layout helps guide users through the site in a persuasive but
            respectful way, encouraging them to explore without crossing into
            manipulation, which happens “when it infringes on user autonomy,
            forcing or tricking users into making decisions they wouldn’t
            normally make” (Mok, 2023).
          </p>
          <p>
            The homepage layout and main navigation are important parts of the
            UI. A top navigation bar shows clear headings like Travel,
            Conservation, Socio-Economic Transformation, Corporate, and Contact.
            These remain fixed as users scroll, making it easier to see and find
            things. Each heading has dropdown menus that lead to specific
            content such as park details, planning your trip, booking options,
            cultural heritage, vacancies, and donation pages. These features
            create a clear and easy-to-use structure that helps users easily
            find what they need.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of UX, the site provides users with a seamless and
            efficient experience. The booking system is a key feature. Users can
            search for availability, select accommodation, book guided
            activities, and make secure payments without having to create an
            account. This design gives users control and improves ease of use,
            following usability principles like control and efficiency (Nielsen,
            1994). It also allows users to change dates, add activities like
            game drives, and make payments with fewer steps, making it more
            user-friendly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website’s booking system uses RoomSeeker™ (KRS, 2024), an
            accommodation booking and property management platform developed by
            Real Travel and Tourism Systems (RTTS). This system allows SANParks
            to manage real-time availability across multiple channels, including
            online platforms, the call centre, and walk-ins. It's designed to
            handle high demand during peak seasons without slowing down.
            Importantly, the system safely manages visitor information and
            follows the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) (KRS,
            2024), building trust and ensuring ethical data use.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website’s information architecture plays an important role in UX
            and helps improve its usability. Content is organised around key
            user goals such as Plan a Trip, Explore Parks, and Get Involved.
            This structure makes it easier for users to find what they need
            based on their goal. The design uses progressive disclosure, meaning
            that basic information is shown first and then more detailed options
            are revealed as users go deeper into the site. This helps lower
            cognitive overload and keeps the experience simple and focused
            (Craig, n.d.).
          </p>
          <p>
            Interactive UI elements like call-to-action buttons, icons, and
            hover effects are used consistently and work well. Buttons are
            placed next to related content, are brightly coloured to stand out,
            and clearly show the next steps in the user journey. For example,
            the Book Your Trip button at the top right of the Home Page is
            bright orange and stands out from the rest of the page. The search
            button uses the same colour, making it easy to find. Icons and hover
            effects also help guide the user’s attention and show what actions
            they can take.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together, these UI and UX features show a thoughtful and ethical
            approach to interaction design. They support transparency by clearly
            showcasing available services, give users control with simple tasks
            and secure systems, and respect their time and attention. The
            SANParks website, through its visual design and user-friendly
            layout, is a good example of how digital tools can support public
            services and meet the needs of local and international users.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Mobile Responsiveness and Accessibility</h2>
          <p>
            About 98% of people worldwide used their mobile phones to access the
            internet in the third quarter of 2024 (Petrosyan, 2025). This makes
            it very important for a website to work well on mobile devices to
            give users a good experience (UX). The SANParks website adjusts well
            to smaller screens, with flexible images, menus that can collapse,
            and text that is easy to read. This mobile-friendly design gives
            users a smooth experience on their phones without needing a separate
            mobile app.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, accessibility on the website (both desktop and mobile),
            especially for users with disabilities, could be better. It does use
            high-contrast colours and text that can be resized, but it is
            missing important accessibility features like screen reader support
            or assisted technologies, alternative text for all images, and an
            accessibility toggle. Not having these features goes against the Web
            Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, which recommend that
            websites should be usable by everyone, including people with vision
            or motor impairments (W3C, 2024).
          </p>
          <p>
            From an ethical point of view, this is an issue of digital
            inclusion. As a public sector website, SANParks should make sure
            that everyone can use its services, especially for important things
            like bookings or learning about conservation. If the site is not
            designed for accessibility, it can make it harder for users with
            disabilities to use it independently.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Transparency and Trust</h2>
          <p>
            Interaction design is not only about usability but also about the
            values built into digital systems. The ethical aspects of
            interaction design include data privacy, transparency in system
            behaviour, and support for informed decision-making (Aparna, 2024).
          </p>
          <p>
            The SANParks website has some ethical strengths. It doesn’t ask for
            unnecessary personal information for tasks like browsing park
            details or checking prices. This shows respect for user privacy and
            reduces data exposure. Additionally, booking forms clearly display
            prices, park rules, and cancellation policies, promoting
            transparency and helping users make informed choices.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site also has a pop-up cookie policy and links to its privacy
            and cookie policies in the footer. However, it could be better by
            adding a clear, POPIA-compliant banner on the home page. As data
            protection rules like South Africa’s POPIA become more important,
            users should easily see how their data is collected and used. Adding
            this kind of banner would be a simple but important ethical
            improvement.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>User empowerment</h2>
          <p>
            Interaction design should give users control, clear choices, and
            feedback during their journey. On the SANParks website, most
            interactions are straightforward and easy to follow. For example,
            when booking accommodation, users get clear feedback, like “date
            unavailable” or “price updated”, and can change details without
            starting over. Clear feedback is important because it keeps users
            informed, reduces user confusion, builds confidence, and makes the
            experience feel smooth and responsive (Agarwal, 2024). When users
            see immediate responses to their actions, they feel more in control
            and are less likely to make mistakes. The SANParks site supports
            this by providing messages that guide users without overwhelming
            them.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Interaction Design in a Public Sector Context</h2>
          <p>
            The SANParks website works well in areas like user interface, mobile
            responsiveness, and clear park information, helping with tourism and
            access to services. However, it could do more to support values like
            fairness and inclusion. The site lacks important accessibility
            features for users with disabilities, which is a big issue for a
            public sector platform that should be available to everyone. These
            accessibility gaps go against the values of fairness and inclusion
            that SANParks stands for. While the site is easy to use and looks
            good, it could improve in making sure all users have equal access
            and meet higher standards of inclusion.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Recommendations</h2>
          <p>
            The SANParks website works well overall, but a few changes could
            make it easier to use and more ethical. It could improve
            accessibility by adding screen reader support, alternative text for
            images, and an accessibility toggle. The site already has a pop-up
            cookie policy and links to its privacy and cookie policies in the
            footer, but it could add a clear, POPIA-compliant banner on the
            homepage. With data protection laws like South Africa’s POPIA, users
            should easily see how their data is being collected and used.
            Offering more South African language options would help make the
            site more inclusive. The website also has a map showing park
            locations and nearby airports, but adding features like virtual park
            tours and route planners would make it more interactive.
            Additionally, adding an accessibility statement that explains how
            the website meets WCAG standards would show a commitment to
            inclusive design.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            The SANParks website does a good job supporting tourism and
            conservation in South Africa and provides a good user experience.
            However, it could improve in areas like fairness, inclusion, and
            transparency. Fixing accessibility issues, adding clearer data
            protection messages, and offering more language options would make
            it better for all users. These changes would help the website meet
            higher ethical standards and set a good example of responsible
            design.

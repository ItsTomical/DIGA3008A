        <section>
          <p>
            The internet isn’t just a tool; it’s a space where power and
            politics collide, especially for countries that are still dealing
            with the legacy of colonialism as they try to shape their own
            digital futures. Although often seen as liberating, digital
            technologies often deepen existing colonial structures by
            influencing how knowledge, authority, and resources are controlled
            and shared globally (Birhane, 2020).
          </p>
          <p>
            In February 2024, during Pakistan’s highly contested general
            election, the government shut down mobile internet and blocked
            access to X (formerly Twitter) after a viral video exposed alleged
            vote tampering (Hussain, 2024). NetBlocks tweeted on 17 February
            2024: “Confirmed: Live metrics show a new national-scale disruption
            to X/Twitter in #Pakistan amid escalating unrest and protests over
            allegations of election fraud, following a high-level resignation
            and public admission of vote manipulation by a senior election
            official” (NetBlocks, 2024).
          </p>
          <p>
            Pakistan’s actions reveal how governments assert control over
            digital space while remaining dependent on Western-owned platforms,
            an ongoing tension at the heart of digital colonialism. This
            reflects what Ballatore, Graham, and Sen (2017, p. 1211) call
            digital hegemony, where few countries shape how information flows
            and who gets to control it. Using Pakistan’s X ban as a case study,
            this essay explores how geopolitics and digital coloniality
            intersect, and how both state power and global tech giants shape
            online control.
          </p>
          <p>
            As late as January 2025, Pakistan’s ban on X remained in place, with
            the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority whitelisting thousands of
            VPNs to regulate internet usage (Khilji, 2025). This ongoing
            restriction highlights the tension between the government’s efforts
            to control online spaces and the reality that Western tech companies
            own and manage much of the internet’s infrastructure and platforms.
            In other words, Pakistan operates within a digital space it neither
            fully owns nor controls. While the government asserted its authority
            by blocking access to X, it had to do so within systems controlled
            by foreign powers. As Graham (2014) reminds us, the internet is not
            a placeless space but one deeply shaped by geographies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shutting down X wasn’t just about technical control; it was a clear
            show of power by the Pakistani government; a way to control the
            narrative both at home and abroad. In April 2024, Reuters reported
            that the Ministry of Interior defended the ban by saying X ignored
            government orders and didn’t do enough to stop people misusing the
            platform. In court, they said the move was necessary “in the
            interest of upholding national security, maintaining public order,
            and preserving the integrity of our nation” (Shahzad, 2024). The
            ministry also claimed that X wasn’t cooperating to fix the problem.
            On the other hand, X said it was still working with the government
            to address their concerns (Shahzad, 2024).
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Alp Toker, director of the internet monitoring group
            NetBlocks, said “Pakistan’s election day internet blackout follows
            several months of nation-scale network censorship targeting former
            Prime Minister Imran Khan and his party, PTI” (Civicus Monitor,
            2024). The shutdown wasn’t just a one-off; it was part of a longer
            campaign to control what people see and say online. It also showed
            how governments aren’t just focused on what’s happening at home, but
            on managing how they’re perceived around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Platforms like X play contradictory roles depending on who controls
            them. For activists and everyday people, X is a space to speak up,
            organise, and take part in democracy. But for governments, it can be
            seen as a threat or source of international embarrassment, turning
            it into an instrument of suppression. In Pakistan, viral hashtags
            and live updates gave people a way to highlight problems with the
            election, but that same visibility made X a target for censorship.
            As Mohamed et al. (2020) point out, digital technologies aren’t
            neutral; they tend to reflect and reinforce the power dynamics
            already in place, including geopolitical power and colonial
            legacies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many Western-based platforms often do not fully meet content removal
            demands from governments abroad, leading some countries to threaten
            or enforce bans on material they consider unlawful or threatening.
            Gillespie (2018, p.36) explains this tension well, pointing out that
            most major social media platforms are legally based in the United
            States, where laws give them strong protections. However, these same
            platforms also serve users in countries with stricter rules and
            legal expectations, especially when it comes to responding to
            government or court requests to take down content (Gillespie, 2018,
            p.36). Because platforms like X mostly follow rules set in Western
            countries, they often miss or ignore local needs and political
            situations in other parts of the world. This can lead to a clash of
            values: X sees itself as a champion of free speech, while
            governments like Pakistan’s say restrictions are necessary to
            protect national security, and sometimes accuse the platforms of
            being biased or interfering. These tensions are part of a bigger
            conversation about who gets to make the rules for the internet.
            Pakistan’s ban on X highlights some of these issues and shows how
            complex digital power and control really are.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pakistan’s ban also exposed a deep digital divide; not just in who
            can get online, but who gets to speak and be heard. Initially, users
            with VPNs could bypass the block, continuing to post updates and
            reach global audiences. But many others were cut off completely.
            This uneven access shows digital inequality is about power, voice,
            and the chance to participate in public conversations, not just
            infrastructure. By August 2024, the Pakistan Telecommunication
            Authority had whitelisted over 20 000 VPNs, mostly for business
            u5ers, effectively deciding who could bypass censorship and who
            couldn’t (Khilji, 2024). Digital rights activist Usama Khilji
            tweeted, “Most popular VPNs appear to be blocked in Pakistan, with
            variance across varied ISPs. Signifies state & @PTAofficialpk
            efforts to solidify censorship & move Pakistan towards the Chinese
            model of firewall, despite liberal constitutional rights. Higher
            judiciary must step in” (Khilji, 2024). This isn’t just censorship;
            it’s about shaping the digital space in a way that benefits some and
            excludes others. As Robinson et al. (2015, p. 570) point out,
            digital inequality isn’t just about technology; it’s about whether
            people have agency and participation online.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pakistan’s X ban is not an isolated incident. Similar platform
            controls during protests have also occurred in countries like India,
            showing that fights over who controls online platforms are playing
            out all over the world. And it’s not just about Western tech giants
            dominating the Global South. It’s also about how governments try to
            manage these platforms, sometimes relying on them and sometimes
            pushing back. In Pakistan’s case, the ban was clearly aimed at
            silencing critics, but it also showed something deeper: the
            government doesn’t have much control over the platforms it depends
            on. That’s the bigger issue here. Digital power isn’t shared
            equally, and many countries are stuck in a tough position of trying
            to use platforms that are shaped by others, while also pushing back
            against the influence they carry.
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, Pakistan’s ban shows how state power, colonial
            history, and big tech all collide in today’s digital world. Shutting
            down X wasn’t just about blocking a platform, it was a political
            move to silence critics and protect the image of a fragile election.
            But it also revealed something deeper: how little control countries
            like Pakistan actually have when the digital infrastructure they
            depend on is owned and run by Western companies. This is what
            digital coloniality looks like in real time: a postcolonial state
            caught between pushing back and still needing the systems it’s
            trying to resist.

          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>
            This reflection explores the design and development process of my
            portfolio website, with a focus on how user interface (UI) and user
            experience (UX) choices impacted the technical implementation. It
            discusses how my folder structure, semantic HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript features evolved throughout the semester. It also covers
            the challenges I faced, such as text styling and mobile
            responsiveness, and the improvements I plan to make going forward.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Folder Structure</h2>
          <h3>Hierarchical Organisation</h3>
          <p>
            My folder structure follows the layout of my website. Each main
            section - such as blog posts, essays, animations, and galleries -
            has its own folder. Assets like images, stylesheets, and scripts are
            also separated into their own folders. This helped keep things
            organised and made it easier to find and update files later.
          </p>

          <h3>Separation of Concerns</h3>
          <p>
            I separated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into different files. This
            made the project cleaner and easier to maintain:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML handles the content and structure</li>
            <li>CSS takes care of styling and layout</li>
            <li>JavaScript adds functionality and interactivity</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            At first, it was hard to get used to this structure, especially when
            I was updating styles across pages. But in the long run, it made my
            code more flexible and easier to debug.
          </p>

          <h3>Modularity and Naming</h3>
          <p>
            I used simple but meaningful class names like
            <code>.content-card</code>, <code>.gallery-image</code>, and
            <code>.lightbox</code>. I also reused layout classes and section
            structures across different pages. This made it easier to scale the
            site and keep styles consistent.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Semantic Markup</h2>
          <h3>Structure and Meaning</h3>
          <p>
            I used semantic HTML elements like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,
            <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, and
            <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>
            to clearly communicate the purpose of each section of content.
          </p>

          <h3>Expressing Content Clearly</h3>
          <p>
            Headings are arranged in a logical hierarchy. Lists, buttons, and
            links are clearly labelled. This helps both users and screen readers
            understand the layout and content.
          </p>

          <h3>Improving Accessibility</h3>
          <p>Using semantic markup improved:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Screen reader usability (clear reading order, headings)</li>
            <li>Keyboard navigation (logical tab flow)</li>
            <li>Search engine optimization (structured content)</li>
            <li>
              Mobile accessibility (better behaviour on assistive devices)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Metadata</h2>
          <h3>Browser Support and SEO</h3>
          <p>
            Each page includes metadata like the character set, page
            description, and viewport settings for mobile responsiveness. This
            helps browsers render the content properly and also improves
            visibility on search engines.
          </p>

          <h3>Useful Metadata for Specific Content</h3>
          <p>
            Pages like essays or blog posts could be improved even further with
            more detailed metadata, like publication dates or keywords. While I
            didn’t include full structured data yet, it’s something I plan to
            explore later for better SEO and content description.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>CSS Styling</h2>
          <h3>Style Consistency</h3>
          <p>
            One of the biggest challenges I faced was maintaining consistent
            text styling. I found myself repeating the same font sizes, colours,
            and spacing rules for headings and paragraphs across different
            selectors. I now realise I could’ve created shared utility classes
            or used CSS variables to keep things more consistent and
            maintainable.
          </p>

          <h3>Visual Design and Effects</h3>
          <p>Some custom CSS features include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Profile photo hover: changes to the original image when hovered
            </li>
            <li>
              Name hover: a waving emoji animates when you hover over my name
            </li>
            <li>
              Blog carousel: scrolls one card at a time within a styled frame
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Mobile Responsiveness</h3>
          <p>
            The site is responsive thanks to Flexbox and media queries, but it’s
            not exactly how I imagined it in my mobile wireframes. Some sections
            feel squished or need better padding/margins on smaller screens. I’d
            like to keep improving the mobile layout by refining breakpoints and
            simplifying the structure.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>JavaScript Functionality</h2>
          <h3>Interactive Features</h3>
          <p>
            I used JavaScript to add functionality without relying on inline
            code. Key features include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Typed name animation on the homepage</li>
            <li>Blog post carousel with navigation arrows</li>
            <li>Image and video lightboxes in fullscreen modals</li>
            <li>Keyboard support (ESC to close, arrow keys to navigate)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Writing Reusable Code</h3>
          <p>
            I avoided inline JavaScript and wrote all scripts in external files.
            This kept the code clean and easier to reuse. For example, the modal
            and carousel logic is used in multiple places across the site.
          </p>

          <h3>Async and Dynamic Elements</h3>
          <p>
            Even without APIs or form handlers, the site includes dynamic
            behaviour such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Modals that load new content based on clicks</li>
            <li>
              Lightboxes that adapt based on how many media items are available
            </li>
            <li>Typing effect that animates over time</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Contact and Links</h2>
          <p>
            I chose not to include a custom contact form. Instead, I used a
            simple and effective solution: a Contact Me button that links to my
            email, Instagram, and other social platforms. This method doesn’t
            require JavaScript or APIs and still gives visitors a clear way to
            connect with me.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Challenges and Improvements</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Repeated CSS for text:</strong> I now realise I could’ve
              used shared classes or CSS variables instead of repeating styles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mobile layout issues:</strong> My responsive design didn’t
              fully match my mobile wireframes. I plan to simplify it and test
              more on devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Learning better CSS structure:</strong> I’ve started
              building a proper global style system instead of fixing things
              case-by-case.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Code consistency:</strong> I’ve gotten better at writing
              clean, reusable code and avoiding bad habits like overly specific
              selectors.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Making this website helped me understand how UI and UX choices
            affect every part of the code — from file structure and HTML to how
            I write my JavaScript. I learned how important it is to separate
            concerns, use semantic elements, and keep styles consistent. Even
            though I faced challenges with text styles and responsive design, I
            now have a solid foundation I can build on. I’m proud of the result
            and excited to keep improving the site as I grow as a developer and
            designer.
